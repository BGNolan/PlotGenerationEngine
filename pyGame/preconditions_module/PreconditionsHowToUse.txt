Uses preconditions inconjunction with t7_pyhop

Big picture
User: creates a boolean equation, adds that equation to a Precondition obj
User: creates a task (pyhop), adds (taskName, task) to pyhop, adds (taskName, preconditionName) to preconditions
When t7_pyhop.pyhop is called: before a task is run the preconditions are checked, if true then task is run

Details
What happens when a precondtion fails
	When a precondition fails in t7_pyhop an addition is made to faillog
NOTE: if you want more to happen, you can add a call to another method in preconditions.addToFailLog method

How to uses this (validator)
	When a pyhop method fails, and it has preconditions, the fail log is updated with that preconditions failmessage
	You can see a pyhop task's precondtions by using its name as key in preconditionsForTasks dic in preconditions

How does a user create a precondition
V1
First they must make a string wich is a (python) boolean equation
Second they must make an array of strings (each item in array is the name of varables used in the equation)
Third they must create a name
Forth they must create an error message
Then they must add theses values to their respective values in a precondition obj
Then they must uses addPrecondtion to add precondition to list of preconditions
They they must uses addPreconditionToTask passing the name of a pyhop method and name of precondition
NOTE: that the parameters passed to pyhop for the task are also passed to precondtion when executed
NOTE: that a pyhop method can have multiple preconditions, and each can have there own fail message

V2
First make a method that returns a bool value
Second they must create a name for precondition
Third they must create an error message
Then they must add theses values to their respective values in a precondition obj
Then they must uses addPrecondtion to add precondition to list of preconditions
They they must uses addPreconditionToTask passing the name of a pyhop method and name of precondition
NOTE: that the parameters passed to pyhop for the method are also passed to precondtion when executed
NOTE: that the number of parameters used in pyhop method must equal preconditions
