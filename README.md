# Plot Generation Engine

An application that implements a modified version of pyhop to allow for user friendly editing of a series of tasks and states. 

## Getting Started

Simply use your favourite python3 interpreter to run pyGame/main.py.

### Prerequisites

Requires PyQt5 and Python 3.5 and later. To install PyQt5 on a Windows, OS X, and/or 64-bit Linux machine, in the command line enter 'pip3 install PyQt5' without the quotes.

## Built With

* [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5) - The GUI tools
* [Pyhop](https://bitbucket.org/dananau/pyhop) - The code that handles the tasks and states, modified to allow for prerequisites to tasks and live editing of the code.
